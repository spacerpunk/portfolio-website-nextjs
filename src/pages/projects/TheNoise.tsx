                     Researing and falling deep on a Close Encounters, Random Event Generators, UFOs and Liminal spaces rabbit hole I came up with and idea for a story (Actually it was a video game first).
                     A world, characters, events, interactions and lore for a world in which my story develops.
                     I don't like to think of it as a Film, Book or Game...it's an idea, a SPACE, and I'd like to explore it and see what outputs I can get from it. Go deep into it and see what I can come out with.

                     Concept work will be feautred here as well as the process of using this creative space to generate Art, working towards making a Short Horror First Person Retro Game and a Short Film.

                     I like the idea of creating things that may exist in the universe that I'm writing about. For that I'm also prototyping some Electronic Devices that generate Sounds with AI and data from weird events
